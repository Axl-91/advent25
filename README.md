# Advent of Code '25 — Multilingual Chaos Edition

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal Advent of Code journey.

Most people pick one language, stay focused, write elegant solutions, and finish December like responsible adults.

Not me.

I'm attempting a completely unreasonable challenge:

### Solve each day’s puzzle (maybe?) in a different programming language (until I eventually run out of languages I know or sanity).
---

>Will I regret this?

Absolutely.

>Will I develop insomnia?

Almost guaranteed.

>Will I consume an excessive (and medically concerning) amount of coffee?
>
Yes.

### Why?...
